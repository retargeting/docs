# saveOrder

This function must be called whenever an order is successfully registered.

For any payment method, the function saveOrder must be called always on the Thank You page (the page where the user is informed the order was registered). If there is no Thank You page, saveOrder function must be called after the order is successfully stored in the database.

For example, for online payment method, saveOrder function must be called after the response from the payment processor is received and the answer is positive (not error or fail). In this case it means the order is successfully registered (was paid). saveOrder function must be called on the Thank You page, when all the registration process of the order is over.

var _ra = _ra || {};

_ra.saveOrderInfo = {
